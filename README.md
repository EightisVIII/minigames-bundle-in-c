# Minigames Bundle in C

Welcome to the **Minigames Bundle in C** project! This repository contains a collection of three interactive minigames, designed and developed for the practical application of a first-year college student's C programming skills. Each game showcases the fundamentals of programming learned and applied across varying levels of difficulty in coding them.

## **Features**

### 1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors**
   - A classic two-player game (user vs. computer).
   - Implements randomness for the computer's choice.
   - Tracks wins, losses, and draws.
   - Has a scoring system that adds one point with every win.

### 2. **Quiz Bee**
   - Contains 100 trivia questions across various categories.
   - Questions are randomized into a set of 20 questions per session for a unique experience each time.
   - Tracks the player's score in each game session.

### 3. **Math Craze**
   - A challenging game featuring college-level math problems.
   - Problems are generated with randomized values and are solved using dynamic algorithms.
   - Encourages critical thinking and application of advanced math skills.
   - Has a scoring system that adds one point with every correct answer made.

## **Purpose of the Project**
This project was created as part of a practical exercise to:
- Apply fundamental C programming concepts such as functions, arrays, and variables.
- Explore more advanced topics, including randomization and algorithm design.
- Enhance problem-solving skills and logical thinking.
- Create a real-world application that is both functional and entertaining.

## **How to Play**

### **Rock-Paper-Scissors**
1. Choose between `Rock (r)`, `Paper (p)`, or `Scissors (s)`.
2. The computer will make its choice randomly.
3. The winner is determined based on traditional rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beats Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.

### **Quiz Bee**
1. Answer 20 randomized trivia questions per game session.
2. Explore a variety of multiple choice, identification, and true or false questions.
3. Each correct answer awards respective points; aim for a perfect score!

### **Math Craze**
1. Solve randomized, college-level math problems.
2. Problems include topics like algebra and basic trigonometry.
3. Enter your answer, and the program will validate its correctness.

## **Acknowledgments**
- Special thanks to professors, peers, and online resources for their guidance and support.
- And more specifically, to my classmate and friend, Mike, for solving a particular linear equation's logic and making it possible
to be solved using random integers.
